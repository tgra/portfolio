# Analytics and Visualization

Demonstration of techniques for analyzing and visualizing Linked Data. This sectionâ€™s exemplars feature projects that use SPARQL queries to extract insights and display data in visual formats such as graphs, charts, or network diagrams, demonstrating how Linked Data can be made accessible and interpretable.


## Project Title
The Gazette Data Model Quality Metrics

### Description
A web-based application that summarises quality metrics for a multi-file semantic data model (OWL files), as well as the corresponding semantic data. Uses data quality measures (completeness and relevance) for the data model, and visualises using summary tabular format and pie chart visualisations.

### Skills Used
Python, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Next.js, Jupyter Notebook, Bootstrap, JSON, OWL

### Challenges and Solutions
How to publish the website in a sustainable way --> Created a static website using Next.js and published to GitHub, activating GitHub pages

### Impact 
The website made tangible two measures of quality with The Gazette data model. Usually the focus of data quality exercises is the data, however, this exemplar demonstrates that quality measures can also be applied to a semantic data model.
