# SPARQL Portfolio

This technical portfolio is designed to demonstrate six key areas of Linked Data and SPARQL, with a focus on demonstrating practical skills through a collection of exemplars. 

Each area features examples that showcase different techniques, approaches, and outcomes demonstrating different aspects of working with Linked Data.

## S – [Semantics and Structure](1.S/README.md)
Exploring the foundations of Linked Data, including RDF (Resource Description Framework) and the Semantic Web. The section includes examples of how data can be structured using RDF, ontologies, and semantic annotations to create meaningful relationships between datasets.

## P – [Programming and Integration](./2.P/README.md)
Integration of Linked Data into software applications demonstrating how to use programming languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript) to interact with Linked Data, as well as how to use SPARQL endpoints to query and manipulate data programmatically.

## A – [Analytics and Visualisation](./3.A/README.md)
Demonstration of techniques for analyzing and visualizing Linked Data. This section’s exemplars feature projects that use SPARQL queries to extract insights and display data in visual formats such as graphs, charts, or network diagrams, demonstrating how Linked Data can be made accessible and interpretable.

## R – [Resources and Retrieval](./4.R/README.md)
Demonstration of querying and retrieving data from various Linked Data sources including the retrieval of data from different SPARQL endpoints, as well as the demonstration of best practices for constructing efficient and scalable queries.

## Q – [Query Design and Optimisation](./5.Q/README.md)
Demonstration of designing efficient SPARQL queries and how to build complex queries for real-world data, optimise queries for performance, and troubleshoot common issues such as query execution time or memory usage.

## L – [Linked Data Principles](./6.L/README.md)
Documentation on the core principles behind Linked Data, including URIs, RDF vocabularies, and data interlinking. Portfolio examples will demonstrate how to apply these principles in practical scenarios, ensuring data can be seamlessly connected across different systems.
